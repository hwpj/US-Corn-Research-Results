Data Analysis Final Project - CSE 163 @ UW, Spring 2020

## Introduction
Our lives depend on agriculture. Besides daily food supply, agriculture also connects with many aspects of life such as trades, feeding livestock, and source of raw materials. Therefore, agricultural production becomes a crucial topic, and it is important for us to learn more about how the agricultural yield is affected by natural elements, e.g., temperature, precipitation. 

Among different kinds of crops, corn is especially worth attention. Corn is very productive and the use of it is so flexible that many other processes rely on the production of corn, e.g., corn ethanol, corn syrup, distillers grains, protein source of animals.

Our project chooses corn, this important kind of crop. We focus on the yield of corn, researching the change of corn yield in the past two decades, and trying to find correlations between corn yield and meteorological elements like temperature and precipitation. Through exploring, we intend to construct a model that describes the trend of corn yield and make predictions about future corn production.

More knowledge about corn production can deepen our understanding of this special crop, and we can better recognize the impact of various elements on agriculture and how this impact is connected to our lives. Through this preliminary attempt at the research of corn yield, we can also gain a deeper insight into how other scientific research has been conducted to help farmers increase agricultural yield. 

## Our Research
### Research Questions
1. Where is the US Corn Belt? How has the corn yield changed over the past 20 years?
   
2. What are some elements correlated to the corn yield?  
   
3. Can we predict the corn yield based on what we have found?
